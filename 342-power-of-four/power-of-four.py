# Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.
#
# Example:
# Given num = 16, return true.
# Given num = 5, return false.
#
#
# Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
#
# Credits:Special thanks to @yukuairoy  for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
