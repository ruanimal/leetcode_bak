# Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
#  Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
#
# Examples:
#
# pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
# pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
# pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
# pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
#
#
#
#
# Notes:
# You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.
#
